 RESULTS FROM DNS OF A TURBULENT DUCT FLOW UP TO RE_tau=1200
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Description: 

A schema of the problem is displayed in the file
DuctFlow_schema.eps. The dimensions of the computational domain are
2pi*h x h x h in the stream-wise and wall-normal directions. The
Reynolds number based on the friction velocity, u_tau, and the
hydraulic diameter, h, is given by Re_tau=u_tau*h/nu. Period boundary
conditions are applied in the stream-wise direction. The flow is
driven by means of a constant pressure gradient in the stream-wise
direction, dP/dx=4*h*u_tau^2. Finally, no-slip boundary conditions are
imposed at the walls. Therefore, the configuration depends only on the
Re_tau. Hereafter, the results are presented in dimensionless form
where the reference length, velocity and time are h, u_tau, h/u_tau,
respectively. Apart from the classical configuration at Re_tau=300,
results at Re_tau=600, 900 and 1200 are also presented here.

The table-headers at the beginning of all the files should be
sufficient to explain the contents of the files.
